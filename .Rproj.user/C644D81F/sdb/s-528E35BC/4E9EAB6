The survey consisted of of 5 questions that evaluated customers' preferences for dealing with customers of their own. Results of the survey were clustered and labels were attached to each: \n- Customer Pleaser\n- Efficient Operator\n- Growth First\n\nThe second part involved scoring new customers that were not part of the original survey. Application was developed for scoring and is discussed further in this presentation. \n\nPlease check the link below for the actual application <https://kostya75.shinyapps.io/ScoreCustomer/>\n\n\nScoring New Customers\n========================================================\n\nWhen visiting a new customer a sales rep would ask 5 questions:\n\n\n<small>\n1. It's important to me how I'm percieved in the community<br>\n2. I'm always trying to undersatnd my customers' needs<br>\n3. Making sure that the store is always properly stocked is important<br>\n4. Getting a deal from a supplier is how they get my business<br>\n5. I'm always looking for ways to attract new customers\n</small>\n\nResponses collected by the app and converted into a numeric vector. Some examples below:\n```{r}\ntest_customer1<-c(5,5,3,2,1)\ntest_customer2<-c(1,1,3,4,5)\ntest_customer3<-c(2,3,3,2,3)\n```\n\nScoring Function\n=======================================================\n```{r}\n\nscore<-function(response) {\n    \n    #Cluster centers. The estimates below could be an output of k-means procedure\n    cluster_name<-c(\"Customer Pleaser\", \"Efficient Operator\", \"Growth First\")\n    cluster_coord1<-c(8,5,1); cluster_coord2<-c(1,3,8)\n    \n    #Linear combinations of responses used to score new observations\n    #The estimates below could be an output of linear discriminant analysis\n    dim1<-c(.8,.7,.3,.1,.3); dim2<-c(.3,.1,.3,.7,.8)\n    \n    #Estimate coordinates in 2D from lda for a new observation\n    coord1<-sum(response*dim1); coord2<-sum(response*dim2)\n    \n    min_distance<-1000; index<-1\n    \n    #Find the distanse to the nearest cluster center and output the \"label\"\n    for (i in 1:3) {\n        distance<-sqrt((cluster_coord1[i]-coord1)^2+(cluster_coord2[i]-coord2)^2)\n        if(min_distance>=distance) {\n            min_distance=distance;index=i\n        }\n    }\n   result<-cluster_name[index]} \n```\n\n\nEvaluate Test Customers\n==============================================\n\n```{r}\nprint(score(test_customer1))\nprint(score(test_customer2))\nprint(score(test_customer3))\n```",
